## Heed
On your turn or before combat starts, you can heed any creatures that you can perceive. Each heeded creature takes up 1 slot of your focus. If you lose your focus or can no longer perceive them, they cease to be heeded.

## Alacrity
When you interrupt a heeded oponent, it does not count against your once per round limit for interruptions.

## Parry
When you or an ally within reach rolls a block check against an attack from a creature you are heeding, you can attempt to parry them. Roll 2d6 if you are wielding a shield and 1d6 for each melee weapon wielded if blocking a melee attack. If any of these dice roll the same number as the block check, you parry the attack as if the attack were blocked.
