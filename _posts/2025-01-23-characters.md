# Characters
Every character has a sheet with two sets of numbered boxes, the exact layout of which is determined by their people, such as human, goblin, elf, or ogre. For simplicity, the rules that follow here assume that the character is a human, which has the sheet shown below. 

![Human Inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedOgreJelly/redogrejelly.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/SlotsHuman.png)

Sheets and adjustments for other peoples are listed in the peoples section, but it is reccommended that campaigns begin with an all human party. After the player’s characters spend significant time with other peoples, like elves or goblins, the judge might allow players to make new characters of those creatures.

## Slots
**Focus Slots** represent the character's mind and concentration. They can hold **ideas** like spells, bonds, and devotions as well as more temporary **interests** like the targets of aiming or heeding.

**Gear Slots** represent the character's body and bags. They can hold **items** like weapons, armor, and equipment. Gear slots come in 3 types:
* Body slots (#2-6) correspond to the actual creature. Armor is only considered equipped in these and wounds can only be placed here. 
* Grip slots (#7-8) represent the items being held in your hands. Weapons and many other items are only considered equipped when in these slots.
* Pack slots (#9-12) represent your backpack, satchel, or other bag. Packs can be dropped making them immediately count as empty.

### Filling Slots
You’ll need a way to represent the ideas and item in your slots. 
* You can just write the name of the item or idea in the slot.
* You can make small sketches of the items or ideas.
* You can print out and cut up squares found in this book and then place the cutouts on the correct slot.

### Marking Slots
You’ll also need a way to mark slots with wounds and conditions. Here are a couple of ideas:
* Use different letters written at the top of the slot to mark conditions. Slash “/” out a slot for a closed wound and “X” out a slot for an open wound. 
* Use transparencies of different colors that are placed over the slots on your sheet.

# Checks
When the judge calls for a check, the player rolls a die (d4 for focus checks or d12 for gear checks) and reports the contents of the slot corresponding to the number rolled (the check contents). Then, the judge announces if the check succeeds or fails based on these contents, and narrates the outcome. The criteria for success varies from check to check, but on a roll of 1, gear checks (but not focus checks) always.

## Cooperation
When a group of characters roll the same check or attack and they can reasonably help each other with it, the players can roll their dice all at once, then, if they wish, each player can exchange one die with another of the cooperating players to get a more favorable outcome.

## Difficulty
When a roll should be easier, a character is skilled at a task, or in an advantageous position, the judge can grant them advantage on a check. To roll with advantage, the player rolls an extra die and, after seeing the results, chooses which single die counts for the roll.  
When the reverse applies, and a roll should be more difficult, the judge can grant disadvantage on a roll. To roll with disadvantage, the player rolls an extra die and, after seeing the results, the judge chooses (unfavorably) which single die counts for the roll.  
Up to 2 advantages and disadvantages stack, so that is possible to roll with 3 dice. If you have both advantages and disadvantages, cancel them out 1-for-1.
 
## Focus Checks
Focus Checks use your focus slots and a d4 for the check.

### Concentrate
When you are wounded or distracted while aiming, heeding, casting a spell, concentrating on a spell, or simmilarly concentrating intently on something, make a Focus(concentrate) check.
If the check contents are _something your're concentrating on_, the check fails and you lose concentration.

### Beseech
When you ask your deity, patron, other master for assistance, make a Focus(beseech) check.
Beseech checks succeed if the check contents are a _devotion_.

### Morale
When you're trying stay calm and collected and not give into your fear and terror, make a Focus(morale) check.
If the slot rolled is marked with terror, you must flee, surrender, or cower. If none of these are rolled, the check succeeds.
 
## Gear Checks
Gear Checks use your gear slots and a d12 for the check.

### Traverse
When you move overland in a potentially dangerous way, such as climbing a wall, running over rough terrain, balancing on a ledge, leaping a chasm, or swimming a river, make a Gear(traverse) check.

* If the check contents are _not heavy_, you succeed in safely moving to where you intended.
* If the check contents are _heavy_ , you fail to reach your destination, instead stumbling and usually falling (prone, off a ledge, into the chasm, etc.) as the judge decides. 

Regardless of the outcome of this check, the player must also mark exhaustion.

### Fall
When a character falls, they make and Gear(fall) check by rolling 1 die for each ~10 ft. they fall onto a solid surface (such as stone) , ~20 ft. they fall onto a soft surface (such as a hedge), or ~30 ft. they fall into water of sufficient depth.

Roll all of these dice at the same time. For each die, the judge determines what happens according to these guidelines:
* If the check content is _a hard, but blunt item_, the character takes a closed wound.
* If the check content is _a hard, sharp, pokey, or stabby item_, the character takes an open wound in that slot.
* If the check content is _an item that could cushion the fall_, that die is disregarded, causing no harm.
* Additionally, if the check content is _an item that can break upon impact_, it also breaks, which may have further consequences for some items (ie. bombs exploding, potion leaking).

Regardless of the outcome of this check, the player falls prone. 

### Sneak
When you try to stealthily move past an opponent, make a Gear(sneak) check. In order to sneak, you must either be obscured from view (cover, fog, darkness, etc.) or the creatures you are sneaking past must be inattentive (distracted, sleepy, etc.). If both are true, take advantage on the check.
If the creatures you are sneaking past can hear, and the check contents are _noisy_, the check fails. 

* Items are considered _noisy_ if they make substantial sound from being moved, like a sack of coins, a tambourine, or a chainmail shirt.
* Rigid items (metal, glass, or stone) that are in the same slot or in adjacent slots count as noisy due to clanking together unless you wrap them especially to avoid this.
* If your vicinity is already ambiently very noisy, you receive advantage on the check.
If the creatures you are sneaking past can smell well (like dogs) and the check contents are _smelly_, the check fails.
* If your vicinity is already ambiently very smelly, you receive advantage on the check.
* If the creatures you are sneaking past have more exotic senses, (like tremorsense, infravision, or aurasensitivity), then the check fails if the contents are particularly apperent to that sense (like shaking, hot, or magical, respectively).
* If the check contents are none of the applicable above, the check succeeds and you go unnoticed.

### Block
When you are attacked with a strike or missile, make a Gear(block) check.

* If the check content is _heavy armor appropriately donned_, _a shield in your grip_, or (against melee attacks only) _a weapon in your grip_, you block the attack and suffer no wounds or conditions from the attack.
* If the check content is _light armor appropriate donned_ you resist the attack and take a closed wound in the slot rolled but do not suffer any conditions from the attack.
* If you rolled a 1 or the check contents _can neither block nor resist the attack_, you fail and take an open wound in the slot rolled (if a body slot), take an open wound in a slot of the judge's choice (if a grip slot or you rolled a 1), or the item is dropped or damaged (if a pack slot).

### Dodge
When attacked with a grab or blast, make a Gear(dodge) check.

* If the check contents are _not heavy_, you dodge the attack and suffer no wounds or conditions of the attack.
* If you rolled a 1 or the check contents are _heavy_, you fail and suffer all wounds and/or conditions of the attack.

# Wounds
Wounds can occur in any body slot. They come in two types: open and closed. When an open wound is taken or a closed wound is opened, the character immediately suffers the bleeding condition (or the condition worsens if they already have it). Wounds also affect your checks:
If you make a Gear check and the slot rolled is already marked with a wound, the check fails.

* If it was a closed wound, the wound reopens. 
* If it was an open wound, the bleeding condition progresses by 1 slot.
* If you take a wound to a slot already marked with a wound, you must succeed at a Focus(grit) check or fall unconscious.

## Treatment
As an action, a character can expend a healing kit on an injured ally within reach to treat a single open wound, making it closed.
 
# Conditions
Conditions are used to simulate anything that spreads throughout the body, usually causing harm or death, often the result of a wound.  
If you have to mark a condition that you already have marked in another slot, the condition instead **worsens**. When a condition worsens, mark a currently unmarked slot that is adjacent to another slot with the condition. Some  conditions have additional rule concerning how they worsen.  
Each slot can only be marked by one condition at a time. If you must mark an already marked slot
 
## Bleeding
Physical open wounds cause bleeding (external or internal). When you take an (open) wound, immediately mark that body slot with bleeding. For each open wound, the bleeding worsens in combat on your turn or while adventuring at the end of each try. 
When bleeding worsens, you must mark a body slot that is closer to your head than the wound causing the bleeding. If you must mark a slot as bleeding, but cannot, your character dies.

## Corruption
Fiends, evil magics, and dark divinities can cause corruption, which then spreads. If corrupted, mark the slot with corruption.  When exposed to additional corruption, make a check, if the slot rolled is corrupted, the corruption worsens. If your focus is full of corruption, it spreads to the head slot on the body. If your body slots are full of corruption, it spreads to your focus.
If your focus slots are corrupted, the judge can call for a Focus(insanity) check to see if you act evilly out-of-character against your will.
Body slots with corruption become visibly deformed, grotesque, or otherwise corrupted. Corrupted body parts might begin to act on their own accord. 
 
## Diseases

## Exhaustion
When characters are forced to march long distances, sprint, swim, carry heavy burdens, or otherwise overexert themselves, they must mark a body slot for exhaustion. 
When you make a Gear(traverse) check, if you roll a slot already marked with exhaustion, the check fails. After rolling, you must mark exhaustion.
If all slots are marked with exhaustion, the character falls unconscious. If you must mark a slot with exhaustion, but cannot, the character dies.
When a character rests for 5 trys, they can remove 1 slot of exhaustion.
 
## Fire
When the contents of a flammable gear slot are ignited, mark that slot for fire. Each round, all slots containing flammable items that are adjacent to a slot marked with fire, also ignite. 
A slot that is on fire for 1 full round takes a closed wound and any flammable item in it is destroyed; if that slot is still aflame after another round passes, the wound becomes open. 
Dropping prone (setup) and rolling on the ground (an action) can put out the fires unless an accelerant was used, in which case the fire must be put out with water, a blanket, or by otherwise quenching it.

## Hunger
Character that go a week without sufficient food should mark hunger.
Each additional week without sufficient food worsens the condition. When hunger worsens, you must mark a body slot that is of a lower number each time. If you must mark a slot for hunger, but cannot, your character dies.

## Ice
When a character is exposed to extreme cold, mark the foot or hand slot for ice
Each 5 trys (10 if well-clothed, 20 if dressed for cold), that exposure to the cold continues, the condition worsens. Each time ice worsens, take a treated wound (from frostbite) in a slot marked with ice. When all body slots have been marked with ice, the character falls unconscious. If you must mark a slot with ice, but cannot, your character dies.
Warming the character removes one mark per try, but does not undo the wounds from frostbite.
 
## Poison

## Suffocation
When a character is choked, drowning, or otherwise unable to breath, mark a body slot for suffocation. As long as suffocation is marked, the character cannot breathe, speak, or cast spells.
Each round that the suffocation continues, the condition worsens. When the head slot has been marked with suffocation, the character falls unconscious. If you must mark a slot with suffocation, but cannot, your character dies.
Removing the source of the suffocation and allowing a character to breathe immediately removes all suffocation marks.

## Terror
When a group is outnumbered by their foes by 2-to-1 or more, after the first casualty on their side of a combat, when their leader is slain, when half of their number are slain, or when a member of their group fails a morale check, mark terror in a focus slot and make a morale check. If you must mark terror, but cannot, make a morale check.
