# Character Sheets
For each type of creature, there is a sheet with numbered boxes for focus and gear slots that serves as a character sheet. The description of that creature also lists their focus die and gear die, their breakdown of body, grip, and pack slots, and any special features the people might have. 
Below are the details and sheet for humans, the default creature for players. When the player’s characters spend significant time with other peoples, like elves or goblins, the judge might allow players to make new characters of those creatures. Their sheets and details can be found in the appendix.

# Focus & Gear Slots
Focus Slots represents the character's mind and concentration. They can hold **ideas** like spells, bonds, devotions, and skills.

Gear Slots represent the character's body and bags. They can hold **items** like weapons, armor, and equipment

Gear slots come in 3 types:
* Body slots correspond to the actual creature. Armor is only considered equipped in these and wounds can only be placed here. 
* Grip slots represent the items being held in your hands. Weapons and many other items are only considered equipped when in these slots.
* Pack slots represent your backpack, satchel, or other bag. Packs can be dropped making them immediately count as empty.
## Filling Slots
You’ll need a way to represent the ideas and item in your slots. 
* You can just write the name of the item or idea in the slot.
* You can make small sketches of the items or ideas.
* You can print out and cut up squares found in this book and then place the cutouts on the correct slot.

## Marking Slots
You’ll also need a way to mark slots with wounds and conditions. Here are a couple of ideas:
* Use different letters written at the top of the slot to mark conditions. Slash “/” out a slot for a closed wound and “X” out a slot for an open wound. 
* Use transparencies of different colors that are placed over the slots on your sheet.

# Checks
When the judge calls for a check, the player rolls a die and reports the contents of the slot corresponding to the number rolled (the check contents). Then, the judge announces if the check succeeds or fails based on these contents, and narrates the outcome. The criteria for success varies from check to check, but on a roll of 1, the check always fails.

## Cooperation
When a group of characters roll the same check or attack and they can reasonably help each other with it, the players can roll their dice all at once, then, if they wish, each player can exchange one die with another of the cooperating players to get a more favorable outcome.

## Difficulty
When a roll should be easier, a character is skilled at a task, or in an advantageous position, the judge can grant them advantage on a check. To roll with advantage, the player rolls an extra die and, after seeing the results, chooses which single die counts for the roll.  
When the reverse applies, and a roll should be more difficult, the judge can grant disadvantage on a roll. To roll with disadvantage, the player rolls an extra die and, after seeing the results, the judge chooses (unfavorably) which single die counts for the roll.  
Up to 2 advantages and disadvantages stack, so that is possible to roll with 3 dice. If you have both advantages and disadvantages, cancel them out 1-for-1.
 
## Focus Checks
Focus Checks use your focus slots and focus die for the check.

### Concentrate
When you are injured, distracted, or initially begin concentrating on a spell, make a Focus(concentrate) check.
If the check contents are A SPELL YOU’RE CONCENTRATING ON, the check fails and you lose concentration on that spell.

### Beseech
When you ask your deity, patron, other master for assistance, make a Focus(beseech) check.
Beseech checks succeed if the check contents are a DISCIPLINE or something specifically IN YOUR MASTER'S DOMAIN.

### Will
When you're trying stay calm and composed despite feeling fear, sadness, elation, rage, or other strong emotions, make a Focus(will) check.
If the check contents are a DISCIPLINE or OPPOSED TO THE EMOTION, you succeed.

 
# Gear Checks
Gear Checks use your gear slots and gear die for the check.

### Traverse
When you move overland in a potentially dangerous way, such as climbing a wall, running over rough terrain, balancing on a ledge, leaping a chasm, or swimming a river, make a Gear(traverse) check.

* If the check contents are not heavy, you succeed in safely moving to where you intended.
* If the check contents are heavy you fail to reach your destination, instead stumbling and usually falling (prone, off a ledge, into the chasm, etc.) as the judge decides. 

Regardless of the outcome of this check, the player must also mark exhaustion.

### Fall
When a character falls, they make and Gear(fall) check by rolling 1 die for each ~10 ft. they fall onto a solid surface, ~20 ft. they fall onto a soft surface, or ~30 ft. they fall into water of sufficient depth.
Roll all of these dice at the same time. For each die, the judge determines what happens according to these guidelines:
* If the check content is an item that could cushion the fall, that die is disregarded, causing no harm. 
* If the check content is an item that can break upon impact, it breaks, which may have further consequences.
Regardless of the outcome of this check, the player falls prone. 

### Sneak
When you try to stealthily move past an opponent, make a Gear(sneak) check. In order to sneak, you must either be obscured from view (cover, fog, darkness, etc.) or the creatures you are sneaking past must be inattentive (distracted, sleepy, etc.). If both are true, take advantage on the check.
If the creatures you are sneaking past can hear, and the check contents are NOISY, the check fails. 
* Items are considered NOISY if they make substantial sound from being moved, like a sack of coins, a tambourine, or a chainmail shirt.
* Rigid items (metal, glass, or stone) that are in the same slot or in adjacent slots count as noisy due to clanking together unless you wrap them especially to avoid this.
* If your vicinity is already ambiently very noisy, you receive advantage on the check.
If the creatures you are sneaking past can smell well (like dogs) and the check contents are SMELLY, the check fails.
* If your vicinity is already ambiently very smelly, you receive advantage on the check.
* If the creatures you are sneaking past have more exotic senses, (like tremorsense, infravision, or aurasensitivity), then the check fails if the contents are particularly apperent to that sense (like shaking, hot, or magical, respectively).
* If the check contents are none of the applicable above, the check succeeds and you go unnoticed.
 
When a character is attacked, they make either a Gear(block) or Gear(dodge) check to determine if and where the attack lands.
Granting advantage to an attack gives disadvantage to the Gear(block) or Gear(dodge) check and disadvantage on an attack grants advantage to this check

### Block
When you are attacked with a strike or missile, make a Gear(block) check.
* If the check content is HEAVY ARMOR, A SHIELD, A WEAPON IN YOUR GRIP (ONLY AGAINST MELEE ATTACKS) you block the attack and suffer no wounds or conditions from the attack.
* If the check content is LIGHT ARMOR you resist the attack and take a closed wound in the slot rolled but do not suffer any conditions from the attack.
* If you rolled a 1 or the check contents CAN NEITHER BLOCK NOR RESIST THE ATTACK, you fail and take an open wound in the slot rolled (if a body slot), take an open wound in a slot of the judge's choice (if a grip slot or you rolled a 1), or the item is dropped or damaged (if a pack slot).

### Dodge
When attacked with a grab or blast, make a Gear(dodge) check.
* If the check contents are NOT HEAVY, you dodge the attack and suffer no wounds or conditions of the attack.
* If you rolled a 1 or the check contents are HEAVY, you fail and suffer all wounds and/or conditions of the attack. 

# Wounds
Wounds can occur in any body slot. They come in two types: open and closed. When an open wound is taken or a closed wound is opened, the character immediately suffers the bleeding condition (or the condition worsens if they already have it). Wounds also affect your checks:
If you make a Gear check and the slot rolled is already marked with a wound, the check fails.
* If it was a closed wound, the wound reopens. 
* If it was an open wound, the bleeding condition progresses by 1 slot.
* If you take a wound to a slot already marked with a wound, you must succeed at a Focus(grit) check or fall unconscious. 

## Treatment
As an action, a character can expend a healing kit on an injured ally within reach to treat a single open wound, making it closed.
 
# Conditions
Conditions are used to simulate anything that spreads throughout the body, usually causing harm or death, often the result of a wound.  
If you have to mark a condition that you already have marked in another slot, the condition instead **worsens**. When a condition worsens, mark a currently unmarked slot that is adjacent to another slot with the condition. Some  conditions have additional rule concerning how they worsen.  
Each slot can only be marked by one condition at a time. If you must mark an already marked slot
 
## Bleeding
Physical open wounds cause bleeding (external or internal). When you take an (open) wound, immediately mark that body slot with bleeding. For each open wound, the bleeding worsens in combat on your turn or while adventuring at the end of each try. 
When bleeding worsens, you must mark a body slot that is closer to your head than the wound causing the bleeding. If you must mark a slot as bleeding, but cannot, your character dies.
 
## Exhaustion
When characters are forced to march long distances, sprint, swim, carry heavy burdens, or otherwise overexert themselves, they must mark a body slot for exhaustion. 
When you make a Gear(traverse) check, if you roll a slot already marked with exhaustion, the check fails. After rolling, you must mark exhaustion.
If all slots are marked with exhaustion, the character falls unconscious. If you must mark a slot with exhaustion, but cannot, the character dies.
When a character rests for 5 trys, they can remove 1 slot of exhaustion.

## Corruption
Fiends, evil magics, and dark divinities can cause corruption, which then spreads. If corrupted, mark the slot with corruption.  When exposed to additional corruption, make a check, if the slot rolled is corrupted, the corruption worsens. If your focus is full of corruption, it spreads to the head slot on the body. If your body slots are full of corruption, it spreads to your focus.
If your focus slots are corrupted, the judge can call for Focus(corruption) checks to see if you act evilly out-of-character against your will.
Body slots with corruption become visibly deformed, grotesque, or otherwise corrupted. Corrupted body parts might begin to act on their own accord. 
 
## Diseases

 
## FIRE
When the contents of a flammable gear slot are ignited, mark that slot for fire. Each round, all slots containing flammable items that are adjacent to a slot marked with fire, also ignite. 
A slot that is on fire for 1 full round takes a closed wound and any flammable item in it is destroyed; if that slot is still aflame after another round passes, the wound becomes open. 
Rolling on the ground can put out some dry fires. When you devote a whole turn to rolling on the ground, roll 3 gear dice and put out the fire in the slots rolled. Dousing with water or otherwise smothering the fire puts it out, removing the condition.
 
## Suffocation
When a character is choked, drowning, or otherwise unable to breath, mark a body slot for suffocation. As long as suffocation is marked, the character cannot breathe, speak, or cast spells.
Each round that the suffocation continues, the condition worsens. When the head slot has been marked with suffocation, the character falls unconscious. If you must mark a slot with suffocation, but cannot, your character dies.
Removing the source of the suffocation and allowing a character to breathe immediately removes all suffocation marks.
 
## Hypothermia
When a character is exposed to extreme cold, mark the foot or hand slot with a hypothermia
Each 5 trys (10 if well-clothed, 20 if dressed for cold), that exposure to the cold continues, the condition worsens. Each time  hypothermia worsens, take a treated wound (from frostbite) in a slot marked with hypothermia. When all body slots have been marked with hypothermia, the character falls unconscious. If you must mark a slot with hypothermia, but cannot, your character dies.
Warming the character removes one mark per try, but does not undo the frostbite.
 
## Hunger
Character that go a week without sufficient food should mark hunger.
Each additional week without sufficient food worsens the condition. When hunger worsens, you must mark a body slot that is of a lower number each time. If you must mark a slot for hunger, but cannot, your character dies.
