# Conditions
Conditions are used to simulate anything that spreads throughout the body, usually causing harm or death, often the result of a wound.  
If you have to mark a condition that you already have marked in another slot, the condition instead **worsens**. When a condition worsens, mark a currently unmarked slot that is adjacent to another slot with the condition. Some conditions have additional rule concerning how they worsen.  
Each slot can only be marked by one condition at a time. If you must mark an already marked slot
 
## Bleeding
Physical open wounds cause bleeding (external or internal). When you take an (open) wound, immediately mark that body slot with bleeding. For each open wound, the bleeding worsens in combat on your turn or while adventuring at the end of each try. 
When bleeding worsens, you must mark a body slot that is closer to your head than the wound causing the bleeding. If you must mark a slot as bleeding, but cannot, your character dies.

## Corruption
Fiends, evil magics, and dark divinities can cause corruption, which then spreads. If corrupted, mark the slot with corruption.  When exposed to additional corruption, make a check, if the slot rolled is corrupted, the corruption worsens. If your focus is full of corruption, it spreads to the head slot on the body. If your body slots are full of corruption, it spreads to your focus.
If your focus slots are corrupted, the judge can call for a Focus(insanity) check to see if you act evilly out-of-character against your will.
Body slots with corruption become visibly deformed, grotesque, or otherwise corrupted. Corrupted body parts might begin to act on their own accord. 
 
## Diseases

## Exhaustion
When characters are forced to march long distances, sprint, swim, carry heavy burdens, or otherwise overexert themselves, they must mark a body slot for exhaustion. 
When you make a Gear(traverse) check, if you roll a slot already marked with exhaustion, the check fails. After rolling, you must mark exhaustion.
If all slots are marked with exhaustion, the character falls unconscious. If you must mark a slot with exhaustion, but cannot, the character dies.
When a character rests for 5 trys, they can remove 1 slot of exhaustion.
 
## Fire
When the contents of a flammable gear slot are ignited, mark that slot for fire. Each round, all slots containing flammable items that are adjacent to a slot marked with fire, also ignite. 
A slot that is on fire for 1 full round takes a closed wound and any flammable item in it is destroyed; if that slot is still aflame after another round passes, the wound becomes open. 
Dropping prone (setup) and rolling on the ground (an action) can put out the fires unless an accelerant was used, in which case the fire must be put out with water, a blanket, or by otherwise quenching it.

## Hunger
Character that go a week without sufficient food should mark hunger.
Each additional week without sufficient food worsens the condition. When hunger worsens, you must mark a body slot that is of a lower number each time. If you must mark a slot for hunger, but cannot, your character dies.

## Ice
When a character is exposed to extreme cold, mark the foot or hand slot for ice
Each 5 trys (10 if well-clothed, 20 if dressed for cold), that exposure to the cold continues, the condition worsens. Each time ice worsens, take a treated wound (from frostbite) in a slot marked with ice. When all body slots have been marked with ice, the character falls unconscious. If you must mark a slot with ice, but cannot, your character dies.
Warming the character removes one mark per try, but does not undo the wounds from frostbite.
 
## Poison

## Suffocation
When a character is choked, drowning, or otherwise unable to breath, mark a body slot for suffocation. As long as suffocation is marked, the character cannot breathe, speak, or cast spells.
Each round that the suffocation continues, the condition worsens. When the head slot has been marked with suffocation, the character falls unconscious. If you must mark a slot with suffocation, but cannot, your character dies.
Removing the source of the suffocation and allowing a character to breathe immediately removes all suffocation marks.

## Terror
When a group is outnumbered by their foes by 2-to-1 or more, after the first casualty on their side of a combat, when their leader is slain, when half of their number are slain, or when a member of their group fails a morale check, mark terror in a focus slot and make a morale check. If you must mark terror, but cannot, make a morale check.
