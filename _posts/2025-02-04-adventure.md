# Zones
Locations are abstracted into zones, which are areas with 1 or 2 interesting features. Usually, a room is made up of a few zones, although small rooms might be just 1 zone. These zones are represented by cards, drawings, or battle maps arranged to indicate their relative position and adjacency.

# Trys
During adventure play, time is measured in trys of roughly 6 minutes so that 10 try takes 1 hour. 

Each try, the party can attempt 1 task.  At the end of each try, the judge rolls a d10. If the judge rolls a 1, the party has an encounter chosen or randomly selected by the judge. If a task takes more than one try, the judge instead rolls 1d10 for each try the task takes, triggering an encounter if any of them come up 1.

Making too much noise, breaking open a smelly potion, building a bonfire, and similar attention attracting actions make a random encounter more likely. For each sense that might alert enemies, (sound, sight, smell, etc.), one more face of the d10 (2, 3, etc.) indicates an encounter. 

Judges should take into account the senses of the monsters in the dungeon when deciding how many senses are affected. Goblins can smell potions, dragons can sense gold, and spellsniffers can sense the dweomer of magic; using these things could attract attention from them if they're in the dungeon.

# Tasks
Most common tasks that can be done in a few minutes take 1 try. Common examples include: searching a zone, picking a lock, or fighting a combat. At the judgeâ€™s discretion, some tasks might take multiple trys.

## Simultaneous Tasks
If characters work on different activities simultaneously, it still only counts as 1 try. However, in dark conditions, such as by torch or lantern light, party members can only work simultaneously if they each have their own light. Sometimes other resources or circumstances will also limit the party's ability to work simultaneously.
