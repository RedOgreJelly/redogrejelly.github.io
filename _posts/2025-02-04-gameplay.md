# Zones
Locations are abstracted into zones, which are areas with 1 or 2 interesting features. Usually, a room is made up of a few zones, although small rooms might be just 1 zone. These zones are represented by cards, drawings, or battle maps arranged to indicate their relative position and adjacency.

# Trys
During adventure play, time is measured in trys of roughly 6 minutes so that 10 try takes 1 hour. 

Each try, the party can attempt 1 task.  At the end of each try, the judge rolls a d10. If the judge rolls a 1, the party has an encounter chosen or randomly selected by the judge. If a task takes more than one try, the judge instead rolls 1d10 for each try the task takes, triggering an encounter if any of them come up 1.

Making too much noise, breaking open a smelly potion, building a bonfire, and similar attention attracting actions make a random encounter more likely. For each sense that might alert enemies, (sound, sight, smell, etc.), one more face of the d10 (2, 3, etc.) indicates an encounter. 

Judges should take into account the senses of the monsters in the dungeon when deciding how many senses are affected. Goblins can smell potions, dragons can sense gold, and spellsniffers can sense the dweomer of magic; using these things could attract attention from them if they're in the dungeon.

# Tasks
Most common tasks that can be done in a few minutes take 1 try. Common examples include: searching a zone, picking a lock, or fighting a combat. At the judge’s discretion, some tasks might take multiple trys.

## Simultaneous Tasks
If characters work on different activities simultaneously, it still only counts as 1 try. However, in dark conditions, such as by torch or lantern light, party members can only work simultaneously if they each have their own light. Sometimes other resources or circumstances will also limit the party's ability to work simultaneously.

# Ranges
The rules often refer to one of the following four ranges between zones:
* (in) Reach: in the same zone – everything here can be interacted with directly. Grabs and strikes have a range of reach.
* Near (by): in an adjacent zone – not in your current zone but you could move there quickly or maybe throw something. Thrown weapons have a range of near.
* Far (away): in a non-adjacent zone, but within sight - you can shoot a bow here but not get there directly. Bows have a range of far
* Remote: too far away to interact with.

# Rounds
During actions play, time is measured in rounds of roughly 6 seconds so that 10 rounds takes 1 minute.

## Actions
Each round, every character gets to take 1 action such as attacking, treating a wound, picking a pocket, casting a spell, or using a potion.

## Setup
Characters can also perform some setup for that action, which is limited each round to doing up to one thing from each of these lists:
* Move to a near zone, Fall prone, Stand up, Aim a ranged attack, or Start casting a spell.
* Stow up 2 items or containers, Drop your pack or an item.
* Draw up to 2 items or containers, Pick up an unattended item in reach.

# Initiative
If the player's characters initiate combat, they take their turn first; otherwise the judge's takes their turn. Next, the other side takes their turn and the round ends. In subsequent rounds, turns are taken in the same order.

## Ambushes
If one side ambushes or surprises the other, then the surprised side cannot take any setup actions for the first round.

## Interruptions
If a character performs setup for their action, then any character on the other side may choose to immediately take a single action (no setup) in an attempt to stop them. However, during their next turn, the interrupter can only take setup, no action.
