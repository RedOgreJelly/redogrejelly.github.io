# Slots
Every character has a sheet with two sets of numbered boxes refered to as slots, as shown on the character sheet below.

## Focus Slots
The set of slots on top are **Focus Slots**, which represent the character's mind and concentration. They can hold **ideas** like spells, bonds, and devotions as well as more temporary **interests** like the targets of aiming or heeding.

## Gear Slots
The larger configuration of slots are called **Gear Slots**, which represent the character's body and bags. They can hold **items** like weapons, armor, and equipment. Gear slots come in 3 types:
* Body slots (#2-6) correspond to the actual creature. Armor is only considered equipped in these and wounds can only be placed here. 
* Grip slots (#7-8) represent the items being held in your hands. Weapons and many other items are only considered equipped when in these slots.
* Pack slots (#9-12) represent your backpack, satchel, or other bag. Packs can be dropped making them immediately count as empty.

## Filling Slots
You’ll need a way to represent the ideas and item in your slots. 
* You can just write the name of the item or idea in the slot.
* You can make small sketches of the items or ideas.
* You can print out and cut up squares found in this book and then place the cutouts on the correct slot.

## Marking Slots
You’ll also need a way to mark slots with wounds and conditions. Here are a couple of ideas:
* Use different letters written at the top of the slot to mark conditions. Slash “/” out a slot for a closed wound and “X” out a slot for an open wound. 
* Use transparencies of different colors that are placed over the slots on your sheet.
