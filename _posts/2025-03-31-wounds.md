# Wounds
Wounds can occur in any body slot. They come in two types: open and closed. When an open wound is taken or a closed wound is opened, the character immediately suffers the bleeding condition (or the condition worsens if they already have it). Wounds also affect your checks:
If you make a Gear check and the slot rolled is already marked with a wound, the check fails.

* If it was a closed wound, the wound reopens. 
* If it was an open wound, the bleeding condition progresses by 1 slot.

## Treatment
As an action, a character can expend a healing kit on an injured ally within reach to treat a single open wound, making it closed.
